    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well it&rsquo;s finally here.
I have needed to do this for way too long and have always gotten distracted by how to achieve it instead of making it happen.
The solution was to use a couple of things I have been using for years and combining those with some rather awesome software to turn those into a blog.</p>

<p>How did I achieve this you ask?
The first bit is <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a> which I have been using to doucument my puppet modules for a while.
The other non obvious bit is <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.
The final bit of awesome is <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> which combines the bits and turns it into a blog.</p>

<p>The inspiration for this was taken from an awesome <a href="http://garylarizza.com/blog/2013/01/17/managing-a-blog-is-insane/">blog entry</a> by <a href="http://garylarizza.com/">Garry Larizza</a> from Puppet Labs about his adventure into the lands of Octopress.
So here I am and here I will likely stay because I can write my blogs in the same environment I write my code so it&rsquo;s more likely to happen more often.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading. I will see you next time.</p>
