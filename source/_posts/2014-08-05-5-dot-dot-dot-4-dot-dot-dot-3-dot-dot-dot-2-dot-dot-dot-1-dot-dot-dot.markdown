Well it's finally here.
I have needed to do this for way too long and have always gotten distracted by how to achieve it instead of making it happen.
The solution was to use a couple of things I have been using for years and combining those with some rather awesome software to turn those into a blog.

How did I achieve this you ask?
The first bit is [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) which I have been using to doucument my puppet modules for a while.
The other non obvious bit is [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
The final bit of awesome is [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) which combines the bits and turns it into a blog.

The inspiration for this was taken from an awesome [blog entry](http://garylarizza.com/blog/2013/01/17/managing-a-blog-is-insane/) by [Garry Larizza](http://garylarizza.com/) from Puppet Labs about his adventure into the lands of Octopress.
So here I am and here I will likely stay because I can write my blogs in the same environment I write my code so it's more likely to happen more often.

Thanks for reading. I will see you next time.
